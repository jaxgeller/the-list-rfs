## Contributing

**Thought leaders** welcome. 

Your requests for startups may be made via pull request.

Inclusion to The List is governed by (not necessarily in this order):

- Quality of the idea 
- Relatability of the problem solved
- Does it scale?
- Does the pull request author have more than 5,000 Twitter followers **or** one podcast guest appearance per quarter?
